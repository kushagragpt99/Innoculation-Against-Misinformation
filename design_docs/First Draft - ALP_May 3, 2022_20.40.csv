⚠️ While there are times we may want to feel awake, one danger of coffee is that it can prevent us from getting a good night’s sleep. This also isn’t just true of coffee, many things can contain caffeine.

Here’s an example. Suppose a friend told you: “I love coffee, but I can’t drink it too close to bed. I have my last cup at about 5pm as soon as I get home from work. That way, it won’t interfere with my sleep.”

In fact, all of these health issues are somehow related to how much sleep we get. Every major system and organ in our body is impacted when we don’t get enough sleep.


💤Most major health organizations suggest that we get at least 7 hours of sleep per night. How much sleep you need, however, varies depending on who you are. Children, for example, typically need more sleep than their parents.

🛏There’s a difference between our sleep duration (how long we sleep for) and sleep opportunity (how long we spend in bed). If someone struggles to fall asleep, or wakes up during the night, they may need to spend more time in bed to get enough sleep.
