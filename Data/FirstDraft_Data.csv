But many people will find that they feel better rested if they wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day.



🥱Our bodies can struggle to adapt to a change in sleep schedule. Sleeping later on weekends usually won’t fully make up for too little sleep during the week. It can also make it more difficult to get up on Monday.

🧐 Here are some examples of regular, 9-hour sleep schedules. Which of these examples do you think could help promote a healthy sleep habit?","Timing - First Click","Timing - Last Click","Timing - Page Submit","Timing - Click Count","⏰There are several strategies you can use to help manage a regular sleep schedule. One useful tip is to set an alarm clock. Alarms help us wake up in the morning, but we can use them to remind us to go to bed on time as well! 

🚿Another helpful strategy is setting a regular bedtime routine. This could involve taking a shower, tidying your bedroom, or reading a book.

Let’s look at an example. Suppose a friend told you: “I’m very particular about my sleep, and I keep the same schedule every week. I go to bed at 9pm every night on the dot. The only exception is Wednesdays when I catch up with friends. I go to bed at 10pm.”

⚠️ While there are times we may want to feel awake, one danger of coffee is that it can prevent us from getting a good night’s sleep. This also isn’t just true of coffee, many things can contain caffeine.

🎂Aging can also alter how fast we process caffeine. The older we are, the longer it can take our brain and body to remove it.

Here’s an example. Suppose a friend told you: “I love coffee, but I can’t drink it too close to bed. I have my last cup at about 5pm as soon as I get home from work. That way, it won’t interfere with my sleep.”

🛏There’s a difference between our sleep duration (how long we sleep for) and sleep opportunity (how long we spend in bed). If someone struggles to fall asleep, or wakes up during the night, they may need to spend more time in bed to get enough sleep.
